# Computational-Methods-For-Data-Analysis
This is a repository for AMATH 482 at the University of Washington taught by Jason John Bramburger.

There are 5 assignments in this class and each folder includes all materials that is related to each assignment.
The topics of the assignments are:

1) Fourier Transform
2) Music analysis using Gobar Transform
3) Principal Component Analysis of a oscillating can
4) Linear Discriminant Analysis on MNIST data
5) Dynamic Mode Decomposition for video separation

When you go into each of the folder, two most important files are:

1) Write up pdf and the MATLAB file that includes all of the work for each assignment
2) README.txt if you have any question regarding that folder

Thank you for reading and have fun going through my work!
